"""Sovereign-themed hashing prototype and accompanying narrative utilities.

This module implements a demonstrative "SHA-ARKxx" hashing pipeline inspired by
fictional K-MATH concepts. The implementation purposefully uses standard
cryptographic primitives (SHA3-512 and BLAKE2b) along with additional mixing to
produce a deterministic digest. No claims are made that the construction
provides security beyond those primitives; it is merely an illustrative
composition.

The script also includes a mock "proof" routine that explains why solving the
Bitcoin genesis block preimage remains computationally infeasible with current
knowledge. The messaging is intentionally educational to counter any myth that
SHA-256 has been broken.
